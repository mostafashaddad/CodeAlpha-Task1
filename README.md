# Mem Sheen Dragon - Network Sniffer

**Mem Sheen Dragon** is a network traffic analysis tool (Network Sniffer) written in Python. The program uses the `scapy` library to capture and analyze network packets and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter` for ease of use. The tool can capture and analyze packets based on various protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, and ARP. It also allows exporting captured data to text files (`txt`), `JSON`, or `CSV`.

## :star2: Features

- **Packet Capture**: The program can capture network packets from a specified network interface.
- **Packet Analysis**: Supports analysis of packets using protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, and ARP.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use GUI for controlling the packet capture process.
- **Data Export**: Captured data can be exported to text files (`txt`), `JSON`, or `CSV`.
- **Data Storage**: Captured packets are stored in an SQLite database for later reference.
- **Packet Filtering**: Packets can be filtered based on protocol, source IP, or destination IP.
